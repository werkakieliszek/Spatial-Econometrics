# Spatial Econometrics Project

## Overview
This repository contains various R scripts for performing spatial econometric analyses. The scripts generate visuals and conduct analyses on spatial data.

## Motivation
The goal of this project is to provide tools and examples for spatial econometric analysis, making it easier for researchers and practitioners to apply these methods.

## Installation
To run the scripts, you need to have R installed along with the following packages:
- `spatialreg`
- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `sf`
- `sp`
- `spdep`
- `spatialreg`
- `stargazer`

You can install these packages using:
```R
install.packages(c("spatialreg", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "sf", "sp", "spdep", "spatialreg", "stargazer"))
